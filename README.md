A collection of Hacktoberfest challenges for Hacktoberfest 2020 and beyond.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Welcome to the WIU Computer Science Association's 2020 Hacktoberfest challenges. There are challenges in each directory with instructions for that directory in the README.md file.

### For organization purposes, please name your file as the following for each challenge:
[your first name and your last name].[the file extension] 

ex: evancolwell.cbl

Please don't commit compiled files if you are using a compiled language, just the source code is what we're looking for.
