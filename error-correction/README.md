# hacktoberfest-challenges

A collection of Hacktoberfest challenges for Hacktoberfest 2020 and beyond.

## Error-correction

This directory has a few files of different languages that will have multiple errors in them. Your job is to pick a file and correct the errors in the file to make it compile and work correctly. You do not have to fix every error but the code that you do fix must compile to be accepted. They will be checked (minus the errors that you did not attempt). 

Good luck and have fun!
