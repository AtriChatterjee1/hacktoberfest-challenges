# hacktoberfest-challenges

A collection of Hacktoberfest challenges for Hacktoberfest 2020 and beyond.

## Learn-a-Lang

Learn-a-lang is the challenge of freedom. Choose a language that you have never done before or used before and make a simple hello world program with it and comment your code on how it works. Your code should compile/run without any errors (warnings are ok). 

Try something new that you want to try and have fun!

If you need an example, I have an example file where I used COBOL as my example.
